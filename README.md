# Buzz's Beamer mtheme
A lighter version of Matthias Vogelgesang's [mtheme](https://github.com/matze/mtheme), modified to fit my personal needs and preferences, maybe even yours! I doubt it.

The objective of this project is to create an easy to deploy .cls file. 

~~Might actually not work.~~ Working and somewhat stable, still wip.
